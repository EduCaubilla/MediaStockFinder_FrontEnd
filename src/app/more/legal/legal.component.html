    <div id="how-we-use-personal-information"></div>
    <h5>How We Use Personal Information</h5>
    <p>
      We take steps designed to ensure that only those employees who need access
      to your personal information to fulfil their employment duties will have
      access to it. We may use the personal information we collect to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        provide you with the MEDIA STOCK FINDER Services, including customer
        support;
      </li>
      <li>

        time; and
      </li>
      <li>
        carry out such other purposes as may be permitted or required by
        applicable law.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="how-we-share-personal-information"></div>
    <h5>How We Share Personal Information</h5>
    <p>
      We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement and
      governmental entities when required by law or in the good-faith belief
      that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response
      to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or
      warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other
      governmental agencies. We may also disclose your personal information to a
      third party in the event of any potential or completed reorganization,
      merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of
      all or any portion of our business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rely on third party services providers to perform a variety of services
      on our behalf, such as identity verification, detection of fraud or
      security threats, telephone or technical support, payment card processing,
      hosting services, and data storage or processing, and we may transfer your
      personal information to our service providers for such purposes. Third
      party service providers have access to and may collect personal
      information only as needed to perform their functions and are not
      permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we disclose your personal information to third parties, we take
      reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this Privacy
      Policy are complied with and that such third parties provide sufficient
      guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures
      to protect your personal information.
    </p>
    <div id="information-security"></div>
    <h5>Information Security</h5>
    <p>
      We take your privacy very seriously and have implemented physical,
      organizational and technological security measures with a view to
      protecting your personal information from loss or theft, unauthorized
      access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. In particular, we
      encrypt the MEDIA STOCK FINDER website with SSL; we periodically review
      information collection, storage, and processing practices; and we restrict
      access to your information on a need-to-know basis for our employees,
      contractors, and agents who are subject to strict contractual
      confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
      fail to meet these obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the measure outlined above, no method of information transmission
      or information storage is 100% secure or error-free, so we unfortunately
      cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to believe that
      your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel
      that the security of any information that you provided to us has been
      compromised), please contact us immediately using the contact information
      in the
      <a href="#contact-us">“Contact Us” section</a> below.
    </p>
    <div id="retention-of-personal-information"></div>
    <h5>Retention of Personal Information</h5>
    <p>
      We will use, disclose or retain your personal information only for as long
      as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which that personal information
      was collected and as permitted or required by law.
    </p>
    <div id="rights-regarding-your-personal-information"></div>

    <p>
      Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time send
      direct marketing materials promoting services, products, facilities, or
      activities to you using information collected from you. If you no longer
      want to receive marketing-related communications from us, you may opt-out
      of such communications by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of

      provide your information to third parties for direct marketing or other
      unrelated purposes without your written consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if you opt-out from receiving marketing-related
      communications, we may still need to send you communications about your
      use of our products or services, or other matters, subject to applicable
      laws and regulations.
    </p>
    <div id="data-transfer"></div>
    <h5>Data Transfer</h5>
    <p>
      Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country,
      province or state (each a “<strong>Country</strong>”) where we have
      facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. As a
      result, your personal information may be transferred to Countries outside
      your Country of residence, which may have different data protection rules
      than in your Country. While such information is outside of your Country,
      it is subject to the laws of the Country in which it is held, and may be
      subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or
      regulatory agencies of such other Country, pursuant to the laws of such
      Country. However, our practices regarding your personal information will
      at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy and, if
      applicable, we will comply with the GDPR requirements of providing
      adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from the
      EU/EEA to other countries.

      third parties, and we encourage you to review all third party privacy
      policies prior to using third party websites or products or services.

    <h5>Children's Privacy</h5>
    <p>
      The MEDIA STOCK FINDER Services are not directed to children under the age
      of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children
      under the age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under

      Services at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personal
      information has been collected on the MEDIA STOCK FINDER Services from
      persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent,
      then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you
      are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 16 years of
      age has provided personal information, then you may alert us as set forth
      in the <a href="#contact-us">“Contact Us” section</a> and request that we
      delete that child’s personal information from our systems.
